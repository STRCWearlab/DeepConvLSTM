# DeepConvLSTM
Deep learning framework for wearable activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent layers.

In this repository it is presented the architecture of DeepConvLSTM: a deep framework for wearable activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units. To obtain a detailed description of the model, please check the paper "Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition", avaiable at http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/115/html

Instrucction to run the model are included in the DeepConvLSTM notebook.
